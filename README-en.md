+ Keyword Search ("Stichwortsuche starten"): Users can input potentially multiple keywords separated by a '+' character to search for within the documents.
+ Results Display: Displays the filenames and found keywords in a table view.
+ User Interface: A sleek, dark-themed interface with clear instructions on the buttons.
+ "Beenden": Terminates the application.
